As you probably know, schools all around the world are closing due to
the COVID-19 Pandemic. But they still need to be educated, so school systems
are turning to the commertial video conference platform,
[Zoom](https://zoom.us). While schools really
[have not been good at choosing software](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/03/06/k-12-schools-us-choosing-affordable-windows-devices-according-futuresource/), this just seems like a unfathomably horrible choice.

For one, Zoom claimed that they were using End-to-End Encryption, but
[they lied about that](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/). What else could they be lying about? Well, probably much more than
we can fit here, but let's explore a few.

They shared user data with facebook [without consent](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zoom-app-personal-data-selling-facebook-lawsuit-alleges/). They
have such bad securety that random people can join their call, which
happens often enough that it even got a nickname - [zoombombing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/technology/zoom-harassment-abuse-racism-fbi-warning.html). Zoom is [closed source](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000126326-Official-Statement-EU-GDPR-Compliance), so you cannot peek inside and see
what they are doing, which opens up Zoom for some major security and
privacy concerns. For example, they can [use malware](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204648/zoom-macos-installer-update-privacy-security-concerns) to install itself,
that can turn on your camera, and it got so bad that Apple had to step in
and [remove it](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20689644/apple-zoom-web-server-automatic-removal-silent-update-webcam-vulnerability).

As you can probably see, Zoom is not quite ready to be used by school systems
with all these security and privacy concerns. There are so many alturnatives
that do not have these issues, like [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si), yet
they seem incapable on using them.
