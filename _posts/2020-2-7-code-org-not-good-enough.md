If you have ever wanted to learn to program, you probably have heard of code.org. Here's why I think you should not use it.

The first reason is that while yes, you learn a programming language, you do not learn <i>how</i> to learn a programming language. Once you learn something like Javascript on code.org, you are stuck there, because there are "lessons" that teach you everything, so you will not know how to learn how to do other things without getting stuck in another code.org trap. You will also only know how to use code.org's <i>lets just say not widely used</i> libraries, and it will be difficult to learn to use another library because of how abnormally they organized it.

Another reason is that they are extreamly limiting. For example, in the 3x3 grid turtle challenge, you have to make a tick-tac-toe board using the turtle with some very limited functions to control it. This is all fine, except for that for some stupid reason, they made it have a minimum turns requirement. I completed the challenge with very few turns by strategically drawing it using the shortest path that did not require turning right, and what do you know? "looks like you did not turn enough times to make a 3x3 grid."

The worse part of it is, my AP computer science principles class requires the use of code.org. yes, you heard me right, this <b>college level class requires code.org.</b>

In conclusion, while at first glance code.org might seem like a great way to learn to "code," you will find it's really a better idea to teach yourself once you look closer.
