You probably have noticed that the comment boxes on our website are nolonger
using disqus. This is because disqus decided that people using their extreamly
pricy 'pro' plans are not enough to pay for their service, and they decided
to force ads on all free users.

This is on top of them already using about 100 trackers and taking a long
time to load because of how bloated it is.

When looking for a new comment box wiget, we did not find anything that
could replace disqus without being expensive like disqus's 'pro' plans.
That changed when we found [utterances](//utteranc.es). utterances is a
comment wiget that is actually just using GitHub's issue api for the comments,
so the service will never cost anything, and plus its open-source!

It even supports a nice dark theme and uses a very customizable github css
library!
